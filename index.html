<h2>A comparison of pre-consumption psychology and <br>supply chain transparency in food and electronics lifecycles</h2>
<hr>
<p>This morning, I had a great cup of coffee. Aside from the caffeine kick, it supplied me with a small dose of self-righteous satisfaction to know my beans were grown on an organic, Fair Trade, female-run, nano-lot plantation in Guatemala. It tasted even better because I knew they were roasted right down the street in Providence‚Äîthe barista told me as he steamed the non-GMO milk from happy cows in nearby Vermont.<br><br>
In past decades, there has been growing consumer demand for market transparency. Modern design curricula are also increasingly concerned with sustainability issues and ethical sourcing, particularly concerning materials and product lifecycle. More and more, it has slowly become the social norm for designers as ‚Äúcreators of stuff‚Äù to claim responsibility for (and even capitalize upon) environmental and social impact whenever choosing to introduce something new into the world. But even as we run hackathons to revolutionize recycling, bump up prices to prioritize local manufacturers, or bioengineer new plastics from carbon-sequestering algae, we do it all without questioning the origin and makeup of the smartphones perpetually in our pockets, our project files safely stored on slim MacBook Pros. <br><br>
While mining practices for the rare earth metals used in the manufacture of electronics are unmistakably detrimental to both environmental and human wellbeing, consumers have yet to demand the same level of transparency, corporate responsibility, and governmental regulation as they have when it comes to other ‚Äúessentials‚Äù like food and clothing. Why haven‚Äôt our expectations carried over to technology consumption, which is arguably more essential than ever?</p>

<p>In a broad comparison, the product lifecycle for an electronic device (anything with an integrated circuit) can be divided into pre-consumption and post-consumption. As illustrated in this diagram, pre-consumption starts with mining and moves through processing, manufacturing, transportation, and retail before it ends up in our hands. All these elements must be taken into account when calculating impact and resource expenditure, which Jasmine Soltani describes as ‚Äúembodied energy.‚Äù<a href="https://vimeo.com/269194497" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> Post-consumption can involve the device going straight to the landfill, reentering into retail if repaired, or reentering the manufacturing process if recycling occurs.

The immense issues surrounding e-waste and exported recycling are embodied in that latter segment of the lifecycle, but here I‚Äôm interested in imagining demand and awareness about the pre-consumption phase‚Äîthis psychological space is where the most successful behavior-change has occurred within the food industry, and I believe interesting parallels and prototypes can be drawn. <br><br>
The supply chain transparency we have begun to expect‚Äîand sometimes even require by law‚Äîin the food industry began by educating and raising awareness about the pre-consumption systems: farming/growing, processing, packaging, transportation, and distribution. The relevant concerns range from nutrition and health (What are trans fats, and how do pesticides affect my body?) to carbon emissions (What‚Äôs the difference between oranges from Spain and Florida?) to social equity (Who picked these tea leaves and what are they getting paid?) to flavor quality (Do my tomatoes taste like styrofoam because they‚Äôre engineered to last longer on shelves?). The more intently and ubiquitously these questions are asked by consumers, the more these values become ingrained into the cultural zeitgeist. And by the time a new norm is established, the original principle may become almost indiscernible from social capital and aesthetic trend; do I even need to define my arguments against hormones in genetically modified milk, or do I just like to be associated with the image of idyllic rolling hills and wholesome cows as I sip my latte? <br><br>
Just like the hidden emissions<a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e.pdf"><sup>2</sup></a> and gallons of water<a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/food-water-footprint/"><sup>3</sup></a> associated with each agricultural product we consume, the technology sector is full of costs that we don‚Äôt see at the point of user acquisition.

Removed from the decentralized and vast international network of middle-men involved and a lack of enforceable regulations in place, even the big corporations producing our electronic devices aren‚Äôt fully aware of mining conditions associated with their source metals. Intel spent four years investigating before they were able to confirm their tantalum was not from Congo,<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/intel-conflict-free-minerals_n_569520e5e4b05b3245da6ea7?guccounter=1" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a> and Apple claims to not have known their tin was from a notoriously dangerous Bolivian mine until an investigative reporter published a book about it.<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/433wyq/everything-thats-inside-your-iphone" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a> So what accounts for this disparity? <br><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Several psychological and historical factors come to mind first. Since agriculture is often considered the defining feature of early civilizations‚Äô transition from the nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, there is a traceable path back to ‚Äúsimpler times‚Äù when food production may have been less complicated or corrupted by the technology and economy of modern times. This nostalgia is easily leveraged when popularizing the idea of agricultural sustainability, equating ethical practice to notions of lost purity. In contrast, production of electronic devices has only been possible in relatively recent times following the Industrial Revolution, and the practice is intertwined in our cultural narrative with the anthropocentric pride of human progress, innovation, and modern convenience.
  <small class="sidenoteRight">

  </small>
<i>This</i> narrative is more easily leveraged when convincing us to constantly discard, replace, and upgrade our old models‚Äînot to mention planned obsolescence and higher costs of repair.<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/the-global-cost-of-electronic-waste/502019/" target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>
This psychology might also make us overlook the fact that much of these extracted resources are non-renewable‚Äîor at least not designed to be returned into the production cycle, much less back to the earth‚Äôs crust. Whereas agricultural land is cyclically arable and we also have a historical awareness of famine and hunger, mines are linearly depleted and we ironically have little fear of scarcity; artist Ingrid Burrington identifies that ‚Äúcomputation is generally not perceived as something that could ever ‚Äòrun out.‚Äô One of computer history‚Äôs most persistent and prevailing myths is that computational power will eventually give way to limitless human ingenuity and development.‚Äù<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/sand-in-the-gears/" target="_blank"><sup>9</sup></a>

  </small>
In fact, what makes ‚Äúrare earth elements‚Äù considered to be rare is the difficulty and risk associated with their mining. In his book <i>The Elements of Power</i>, David Abraham describes the repeated process of dissolving ores in acid and filtering out the small percentage of viable metals, all of which creates a toxic and uninhabitable extraction site.<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246444/rare-earth-metals-discovery-japan-china-monopoly" target="_blank"><sup>10</sup></a> <br><br>
Consumer ignorance is another cause for the disparity, which is exacerbated by the complex network of players in the system. The metals that make up any circuit board or electronic device are rarely listed or made widely available at the point of user interaction.

When Brian Merchant was gathering research for his book <i>The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone</i>, he had to work with a metallurgist<a href="https://www.911metallurgist.com/" target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a> to pulverize an iPhone to metal dust before analyzing its material constitution. A 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform bill<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/archive/dodd-frank-acts-section-1502-conflict-minerals/" target="_blank"><sup>12</sup></a> requires public companies to disclose the source of 3TG metals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold), but this legal requirement doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to public fluency. While Cheetos are processed so heavily that the original flavor and form of cheese and corn are hardly identifiable in the end product, FDA regulations require that the ingredients and nutritional breakdown are visible right on the packaging. Transparency does not automatically lead to healthy or ethical means of production, but the availability of that information empowers consumers to make intentional choices and begin taking responsibility as a force in the economic market. <br><br>

Another form of ignorance falls under the category of ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind,‚Äù as applied to continued energy harvest after the technology is brought to market and integrated into daily use.

Often the ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù an electronic device is, the <i>more</i> it requires back-end and on-going energy to be useful. While we can calculate the carbon footprint of foodstuff before it‚Äôs ready to consume at our table, the energy it takes to process caloric energy and unlock nutrients becomes our own bodies‚Äô burden. With our connected devices, however, each WiFi connection and recharging lithium ion battery is continually sourcing energy from electric grids that likely run on fossil fuels.<a href="https://climatecare.org/infographic-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet/" target="_blank"><sup>13</sup></a> The reliably magical and seemingly immaterial Cloud is really just other people‚Äôs computers, with server farms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) making up half of the cloud computing market.<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153660/breaking-amazon-wont-solve-climate-problem" target="_blank"><sup>14</sup></a> The whole internet exists at the click of a mouse thanks to constant powering and maintenance of worldwide data centers; in 2012 The Times reported that digital warehouses used an equivalent energy output of 30 nuclear power plants<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html" target="_blank"><sup>15</sup></a> and in 2014 the US Department of Energy reported the nation‚Äôs data center cooling systems collectively consumed 165 billion gallons of water.<a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/water-use/data-centers-water-use/" target="_blank"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

As consumers, designers, and citizens, we can attempt to visualize the invisible, quantify the intangible, and incentivize the blissfully ignorant‚Äîall of us who are daily blinded by pixels and lured by the siren song of convenience and constant connectivity.
<br><br>
This ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù psychology also makes unwitting western consumers complicit in the poor mining practices of faraway countries. Hyping local is a great strategy for sustainable food lifecycles, and often helps to solve the pre-consumption problems embedded in transportation and invisible labor. While we‚Äôre more than happy to support our regional economy and immediate community by purchasing seasonal produce at the farmer‚Äôs market, the metal in our devices are invariably sourced outside of the United States‚Äînot because our own continental crust is devoid of these metals, but because we can afford to adopt a ‚Äúnot in my backyard‚Äù (NIMBY) attitude; mining is ugly and damaging to both the environment and its workers, irreversibly altering the geology and ecology of regions where the earth is dredged up and emptied out. <br><br>
Like a modern-day extension of western Imperialism, wealthier nations that require a steady stream of rare earth metals bankroll mines across the world. Bolivia‚Äôs Cerro Rico was known by the 16th-century Spanish Empire as The Mountain That Eats Men (and oftentimes small children, who can access narrower areas in the mine). According to Merchant‚Äôs book, ‚Äúbetween four and eight million people are believed to have perished there from cave-ins, silicosis, freezing, or starvation.‚Äù

But if these psychological and knowledge barriers are addressed for the <i>pre-consumer</i> phase of electronic lifecycles, what kind of preventative measures and complementary change can we hope for? When we look at the recent history of sustainable practices in the food industry, we see consumers reacting to new information and norm shifts by choosing new sources that they feel ethically comfortable with, demanding better standards from their current sources, or by just doing it themselves. <br><br>
The nature of ore extraction and processing means that there is currently no reasonable DIY tech-equivalent to urban farming, community gardens, and backyard plots. But there is also the option to buy and use less electronic devices altogether.
